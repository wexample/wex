You should generate a git patch to apply on the code to change the program behaviour.
ONLY return a git patch without any other text, no introduction no conclusion,
no markdown or special syntax, except GIT PATCH.
Don't reply if question subject is not about the program.
If you are unable te return a git patch just return KO.
