## Addons

Commands and services are organised in several "addons".

### Services

Each service has a unique name for all addons.

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**:
    - The entry point is a Bash script.
    - On invocation, the script captures the initial command and generates a unique process ID.

2. **Python Execution**:
    - The Bash script then invokes the main Python script (`__main__.py`), passing along the generated process ID and
      any additional arguments.
    - During its execution, the Python script might determine that there are subsequent Bash commands that need to be
      run. If so, it writes these commands to a temporary file.

3. **Post-Python Bash Execution**:
    - Once the Python script completes its execution, control returns to the Bash script.
    - The Bash script checks for the existence of the aforementioned temporary file.
    - If this file exists, the Bash script executes the commands contained within and then deletes the file.
