# Migration to Wex v6

## Context

- Current version: `/home/weeger/Desktop/WIP/WEB/WEXAMPLE/WEX/local/wex`
- New version: `/home/weeger/Desktop/WIP/WEB/WEXAMPLE/WEX/local/wex-6`

## Objectives

Version 6 maintains the same core objectives and main usage as the current version, but aims for overall improvement in the following aspects:

- Code quality
- Execution quality
- User interface
- Extensibility
- Overall program robustness

## Migration Methodology

The migration process follows these steps:

1. Compare directories and files structure between v5 and v6
2. Identify and prioritize core functionalities
3. Migrate core features from v5 to v6 with improvements
4. When possible, backport v6 improvements to v5

This parallel development approach allows for continuous improvement of both versions while ensuring a smooth transition to v6.
