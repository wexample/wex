# Current Development Status

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully reconciled the old draft with the latest library developments
- Basic command system infrastructure is in place

## Command System Components

### Resolvers
- ‚úÖ "service" resolver is functional
- üîÑ Need to implement additional resolvers to test the kernel:
  - `addon` resolver
  - `user` resolver (potential)

### Runners
- ‚úÖ "python" runner is implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Command execution pathway is not fully tested:
  - Need to verify Python script path resolution
  - Module execution mechanism needs to be validated

## Next Objectives

### Primary Goal
Execute the command `addons/default/instruction/version/increment`:
1. Implement the `addon` resolver
2. Verify path resolution for addon commands
3. Test complete execution flow

### Command Response System
Current status:
- Using a basic `default_response`
- Disconnected from the prompt system (unlike the first draft version)
- TODO: Implement the relationship between:
  - Command responses
  - Prompt responses (display-only)
  - Need to maintain the subtle connection between these components

## Known Issues

1. Command Execution
   - Full execution path not yet tested
   - Python script location and resolution needs verification
   - Internal module execution requires testing

2. Response System
   - Current implementation is basic
   - Missing integration with prompt system
   - Need to restore the sophisticated response handling from the draft

## Next Steps

1. Test complete command execution flow
2. Implement addon resolver
3. Verify path resolution system
4. Restore and implement proper response handling
5. Test with the version increment command as a reference implementation
