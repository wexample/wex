# Vision

You are reading this file because you need to understand what wex v6 is trying to be — not just what it does, but what standard it must meet.

## Purpose

Wex is the backbone of an entire infrastructure. Every application, every team workflow, every deployment depends on it. If wex is solid, everything built on top of it is solid. If it is fragile, everything is fragile.

This is not a side tool. It is the foundation.

## Standard

Wex v6 must be a world-class CLI — in code quality, in robustness, and in user experience. Every decision, from architecture to error messages, must reflect that standard.

## Error handling

Errors must be handled with surgical precision:

- Every exception must be thrown intentionally, with a typed and descriptive exception class
- Every exception must be caught at the right level — not too early (losing context), not too late (crashing silently)
- Error messages must tell the user exactly what happened, what was expected, and how to debug it
- Stack traces must be available in verbose mode, hidden otherwise
- No silent failures. No bare `except`. No generic `Exception("something went wrong")`

## Robustness

- Every public method must be predictable: same inputs always produce same outputs or the same well-defined error
- Side effects must be explicit and reversible where possible
- External calls (filesystem, Docker, network) must fail loudly with actionable messages
- The system must degrade gracefully — a broken addon must not crash the kernel

## User experience

- Commands must feel fast and responsive
- Output must be clean: structured, readable, and consistent across all commands
- Progress must be visible for long operations
- Help text must be genuinely helpful — not just a parameter list
- Verbosity levels must be respected everywhere: quiet is quiet, verbose is verbose

## Application lifecycle (Docker and beyond)

v5 managed Docker apps but with fragility. v6 must do it properly:

- App lifecycle (start, stop, restart, health check) must be atomic and observable
- Configuration must be declarative and version-controlled
- Services must be composable and inherit cleanly
- The framework must not assume Docker — it must be extensible to other runtimes

## Code quality

- One class per file
- No dead code, no commented-out blocks, no TODOs left unresolved
- Type hints everywhere
- Self-documenting code — comments only where intent is non-obvious
- Tests for every mechanism, not just every command
